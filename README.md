# HEALTH_ANALYSIS
The project creates an enhanced BMI calculator using Tkinter and Matplotlib. Users input their details, and it calculates BMI, classifies it, provides health tips, estimates daily calorie needs, and visualizes BMI with a bar chart. It also includes functionality to save data to a CSV file and reset inputs for new calculations.
